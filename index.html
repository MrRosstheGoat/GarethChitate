        <h3 class="text-animation">I am a <span></span></h3>
        <p> As Gareth Chitate, I see myself as more than just a designer or developer—I’m a creator of experiences. In UI design, 
            I aim to make interfaces intuitive and welcoming, 
            drawing users in without overwhelming them. 
            My graphic design work brings brands to life, while my web design ensures each project flows smoothly across all devices. 
            And as a front-end developer, I don’t just code for function; 
            I strive for speed, performance, and accessibility. To me, design isn’t just about looking good—it’s 
            about working
             well for everyone.</p>

                    <h3>High School</h3>
                    <p>As a web developer, I create websites that are as functional as they are stunning. 
                        My journey into tech began at Mother Touch, where I not only discovered my passion for computers 
                        and programming but also served as a prefect, gaining valuable leadership experience. 
                        I use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks to build responsive, fast, and user-friendly sites. 
                        With a focus on performance, accessibility, and security, I craft digital experiences that are smooth, interactive, 
                        and engaging. 
                        Web development is my perfect mix of creativity and problem-solving, 
                        and I’m always excited to push the limits of what’s possible.</p>

                    <p>Studying software engineering at Telone Center for Learning in Belvedere, 
                        I’m gaining a wealth of knowledge that’s reshaping my view of technology. Every day, 
                        I learn new skills and develop a mindset focused on innovation and growth. Attending events 
                        like HackerThon fuels my passion to push boundaries and keep learning. 
                        I’m excited for the future and eager to contribute to the ever-evolving world of technology.</p>

                        I've been making the most of my time by working on personal projects and contributing to public ones. 
                        These experiences have allowed me to sharpen my skills, tackle real-world challenges, and build a diverse portfolio. 
                        From developing websites to experimenting with new technologies, 
                        I’ve gained hands-on experience that’s been just as valuable as any formal internship. 
                        I’m eager for the opportunity to apply what 
                        I’ve learned and take my passion for web development to the next level.</p>
